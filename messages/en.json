    "sushi_desc1": "A beautifully arranged sushi platter catches the eye. Various sushi types including salmon, tuna, shrimp, and egg nigiri are elegantly placed on a wooden plate, each piece distinctly colored and visually appealing.",
    "sushi_desc2": "The vivid orange of salmon, deep red of tuna, white of squid, and yellow of egg create striking color contrasts. Green wasabi and pink ginger placed between the sushi add delightful color accents.",
    "sushi_desc3": "The warm wooden tones of the background harmonize with the fresh ingredients, creating an appetizing image that also works beautifully as a puzzle. The regular shape of each sushi piece combined with varying textures of different toppings provides an interesting challenge.",
    "sushi_tips3x3": "Each piece contains 2-3 sushi. Use the topping colors (orange, red, white, yellow) as position markers. The plate edges and background boundaries serve as excellent reference points.",
    "sushi_tips4x4": "A single sushi may span multiple pieces. Observe the color boundaries of toppings and the ratio of white rice visible. The positions of garnishes like wasabi and ginger become important hints.",
    "sushi_tips5x5": "In smaller pieces, texture differences between toppings become crucial. Focus on salmon's stripe pattern, tuna's smooth surface, and egg's uniform color. The wood grain direction of the plate is also helpful.",
    "sushi_whyGreat": "The sushi image provides easy area distinction thanks to each topping's distinct color, while the repeating similar shapes of sushi pieces offer an appropriate challenge. The delicious-looking visuals add extra enjoyment to the puzzle-solving experience.",
    "balloon_desc1": "A spectacular scene of colorful hot air balloons filling the vast sky. Red, yellow, blue, green, and orange balloons float against a clear sky, creating a scene straight out of a fairy tale.",
    "balloon_desc2": "Each balloon features unique stripe patterns and designs, with varying sizes creating excellent depth perspective - closer ones appear larger, distant ones smaller. The sky gradient and varying balloon heights add dimensional depth to the photo.",
    "balloon_desc3": "The horizon and landscape below contrast with the warm colors of the balloons, while basket details are sharply captured. This adventure-inspiring image provides great satisfaction upon puzzle completion.",
    "balloon_tips3x3": "Use the sky-ground boundary to distinguish top from bottom. Identify the most prominent large balloon's color as your reference point for quick positioning.",
    "balloon_tips4x4": "Balloon stripe patterns are key clues. Remember each balloon's unique color combination and use sky brightness variations (deeper blue at top) to your advantage.",
    "balloon_tips5x5": "With many similar sky-colored pieces, focus on cloud positions and spacing between balloons. Identifying the positions of small, distant balloons first helps establish the overall composition.",
    "balloon_whyGreat": "The hot air balloon image provides natural reference points through its diverse colored balloons, while the expansive sky area offers appropriate challenge. The vibrant colors and open composition maximize the satisfaction of puzzle completion.",
    "village_desc1": "Colorful buildings reminiscent of Italy's Cinque Terre are nestled on cliffsides. Pastel-toned pink, yellow, orange, and light green buildings are stacked in layers, creating a charming scene like stacked building blocks.",
    "village_desc2": "Windows, balconies, and shutters of each building are captured in fine detail, providing rich visual information. Narrow alleys and stairs between buildings are visible, and strong Mediterranean sunlight casts shadows on building surfaces, adding dimensionality.",
    "village_desc3": "The sea and harbor below create complementary contrast with the warm building colors. This image evokes the excitement and romance of travel, with each building's different color and size serving as excellent puzzle reference points.",
    "village_tips3x3": "Divide areas by building colors. Broadly separating pink buildings, yellow buildings, and sea areas makes positioning easy. The sky and sea positions are the best reference points.",
    "village_tips4x4": "Each building's unique color is the key clue. Observe window patterns and balcony positions. Shadow directions between buildings help determine left-right orientation of pieces.",
    "village_tips5x5": "With many similar pastel-toned buildings, detailed observation is necessary. Focus on details like number of windows, shutter colors, and presence of balconies. Rooflines and building boundaries are important clues.",
    "village_whyGreat": "The village image provides rich visual clues through each building's unique colors and details. The regular yet irregular building arrangement creates optimal puzzle difficulty, and you can enjoy a beautiful Mediterranean landscape upon completion.",
    "coral_desc1": "A stunning underwater scene showcases vibrant coral reefs. Bright orange, purple, and pink corals glow luminously under light filtering through clear blue ocean water.",
    "coral_desc2": "Branching coral formations and round brain coral patterns create diverse textures. Small tropical fish swimming between corals add color highlights, while the contrast between blue water and warm coral hues creates beautiful visual harmony.",
    "coral_desc3": "Light ripple patterns passing through the water surface cast a dreamy glow on the corals. The complex yet beautiful patterns created by nature make this an captivating puzzle image.",
    "coral_tips3x3": "Broadly divide areas by coral colors. Orange corals, purple corals, and blue water areas are clearly separated, making positioning easy. Look for pieces with tropical fish first.",
    "coral_tips4x4": "Coral branch direction and shape are key clues. Distinguish between branching corals and brain coral textures, and observe brightness changes in the water.",
    "coral_tips5x5": "With large areas of similar coral colors, detailed observation is needed. Focus on coral branch directions, shadows from light angles, and positions of small marine creatures.",
    "coral_whyGreat": "The coral reef image provides visual richness through vibrant colors and complex natural patterns. Organic shapes offer appropriate challenge while nature's beauty enhances the puzzle-solving experience.",
    "candy_desc1": "Colorful candies fill the entire image. Rainbow-colored candies in red, yellow, green, blue, and purple spread across the frame, creating a visual that brings instant joy.",
    "candy_desc2": "Light reflections on each candy's smooth surface create unique glossy effects. Candies vary in size and shape, creating visual rhythm, with interesting texture differences between transparent and opaque candies.",
    "candy_desc3": "The uneven, naturally mixed distribution of colors provides appropriate puzzle difficulty. The bright, cheerful colors deliver positive energy throughout the solving experience, evoking childhood memories of candy shops.",
    "candy_tips3x3": "Identify the major color distributions. Separating areas with predominantly red candies, green candies, etc. makes positioning easy. Particularly large candies serve as great reference points.",
    "candy_tips4x4": "With similar-colored candies scattered across multiple areas, observe candy sizes and surrounding color combinations together. Uniquely shaped candies and light reflection patterns are important hints.",
    "candy_tips5x5": "In smaller pieces, focus on overall color density rather than individual candy shapes. Use the differences between areas where specific colors are concentrated versus mixed-color areas. Light reflection direction on candy surfaces also provides clues.",
    "candy_whyGreat": "The candy image offers easy area distinction thanks to rich color diversity, while similarly-sized repeating candies provide appropriate challenge. The vibrant colors deliver great visual satisfaction upon completion."

    "post1Content2Title": "Step 1: Solve the First Row",
    "post1Content2": "Start by completing the top row from left to right. Place each tile one at a time while being careful not to disturb already-placed tiles. The last two tiles of the row need to be placed simultaneously using a specific technique.",
    "post1Content3Title": "Step 2: Solve the Second Row",
    "post1Content3": "Once the first row is complete, use the same approach for the second row. The key is to never disturb the completed top row. Only move tiles downward and sideways to position them correctly.",
    "post1Content4Title": "Step 3: Solve the Last Two Rows Together",

    "post2Content1": "Jigsaw puzzles may seem like a simple matching game, but using efficient strategies can dramatically reduce your completion time.",
    "post2Content2Title": "1. Find Edge Pieces First",
    "post2Content2": "The fundamental jigsaw strategy is to build the border first. Gather all pieces with a flat edge and assemble the frame. This creates a clear boundary that makes placing interior pieces much easier.",
    "post2Content3Title": "2. Sort by Color",
    "post2Content3": "Group pieces by similar colors or patterns. Separate sky pieces, grass pieces, building pieces, etc. This narrows down the candidates for each position and speeds up the matching process significantly.",
    "post2Content4Title": "3. Complete Distinctive Areas First",
    "post2Content4": "Focus on areas with unique features like faces, text, or distinctive patterns. These areas are easier to identify and give you anchor points for surrounding pieces.",
    "post2Content5Title": "4. Use the Reference Image",
    "post2Content5": "PuzzlePlay displays the original image alongside the puzzle. Pay attention to color boundaries, gradient directions, and pattern transitions to more accurately determine where each piece belongs.",
    "post2Content6Title": "5-7. Advanced Strategies",
    "post2Content6": "Focus on piece shapes — matching tabs and blanks by size and shape is often more reliable than color alone. Work on multiple areas simultaneously rather than fixating on one spot. And when stuck on a difficult piece, skip it and come back later with fresh eyes.",

    "post5Desc": "From 3x3 to 8x8, learn the characteristics of each difficulty level and find the one that's right for you.",
    "post5Content1": "The fun of puzzles comes from the right difficulty level. Too easy and it's boring; too hard and you'll give up. Find the perfect challenge for your skill level.",
    "post5Content2Title": "3x3 (Easy) - For Beginners",
    "post5Content2": "The most basic difficulty with just 9 pieces. Perfect for puzzle newcomers and children. Slide puzzles take 1-2 minutes on average, while jigsaw puzzles can be completed in 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
    "post5Content3Title": "4x4 (Medium) - A Light Challenge",
    "post5Content3": "16 pieces provide a moderate challenge. If you can solve 3x3 comfortably, try 4x4. Slide puzzles start requiring strategic thinking, and color differentiation becomes important for jigsaw puzzles.",
    "post5Content4Title": "5x5 (Hard) - A Real Challenge",
    "post5Content4": "25 pieces significantly increase the difficulty. Slide puzzles require planning dozens of moves ahead, while jigsaw puzzles have many similar-colored pieces requiring careful observation. Try the Challenge Mode to compete on the leaderboard!",
    "post5Content5Title": "6x6+ (Very Hard) - For Experts",
    "post5Content5": "With 36+ pieces, considerable patience and skill are needed. An 8x8 puzzle (64 pieces) takes significant time to complete, but the sense of achievement is unmatched.",
    "post5Content6Title": "Difficulty Selection Tips",
    "post5Content6": "Start with 3x3 to get familiar with the mechanics. Once you can comfortably solve a difficulty level three times, move to the next. The type of photo also affects difficulty — colorful photos are easier, while monochrome photos are harder.",

    "post6Title": "How to Choose the Perfect Photo for Puzzles: A PuzzlePlay Guide",
    "post6Desc": "Learn what makes a great puzzle photo. We share tips for selecting the perfect image for the best puzzle experience on PuzzlePlay.",
    "post6Content1": "A great puzzle experience starts with choosing the right photo. While any photo can become a puzzle, the characteristics of the photo greatly affect the fun and difficulty of the puzzle. Here's how to select the optimal photo for the best experience on PuzzlePlay.",
    "post6Content2Title": "Jigsaw vs Slide Puzzle: Photo Selection Differences",
    "post6Content2": "Jigsaw puzzles require distinguishing piece boundaries, so photos with rich color variations work best. Slide puzzles involve pushing tiles into the correct order, so each tile needs to be distinguishable from others. Landscape photos with natural gradients work better for jigsaw puzzles, while photos with distinct regional colors are more suitable for slide puzzles.",
    "post6Content3Title": "Why High Color Contrast Photos Work Best",
    "post6Content3": "High-contrast photos make it easier to determine each puzzle piece's position, providing appropriate difficulty. For example, a photo with blue sky, green trees, and red flowers offers rich color clues. Among PuzzlePlay's challenge images, 'Donuts' and 'Paint' are classic high-contrast examples. Conversely, photos of all-white snow fields or blue ocean are extremely difficult as pieces are hard to distinguish.",
    "post6Content4Title": "Proper Aspect Ratio — PuzzlePlay's Ratio Warning Feature",
    "post6Content4": "PuzzlePlay displays a warning when uploaded images have extreme aspect ratios. Square-shaped photos with similar width and height work best for puzzles. Overly long or wide panoramic photos can create unbalanced pieces that make jigsaw puzzle play uncomfortable. Photos taken with smartphones in 4:3 or 16:9 ratios work well in most cases, with 1:1 square photos being the most ideal.",
    "post6Content5Title": "Photo Types to Avoid",
    "post6Content5": "Monochrome photos (e.g., white walls, clear sky only) make it extremely difficult to distinguish pieces. Complex repeating patterns (e.g., tile floors, checkerboard) also make difficulty extremely high as all pieces look similar. Very low resolution photos result in blurry puzzle pieces for an unpleasant experience. Also, text-heavy images may not look good when text gets cut across pieces.",
    "post6Content6Title": "Recommended Photo Styles by Difficulty (3x3 to 8x8)",
    "post6Content6": "For 3x3-4x4 (Easy-Medium), photos with distinct regional colors work best. Fruit baskets, colorful flower fields, and diverse food photos are ideal. For 5x5-6x6 (Hard), we recommend photos with moderate complexity. City nightscapes, gardens, and pet photos suit this difficulty well. For 7x7-8x8 (Very Hard), detail-rich photos work best. Natural landscapes, architecture, and complex art patterns requiring careful observation are ideal.",
    "post6Content7Title": "Resolution Tips for the Best PuzzlePlay Experience",
    "post6Content7": "PuzzlePlay automatically resizes uploaded images, but higher original resolution means clearer puzzles. We recommend at least 800x800 pixels, with around 2000x2000 pixels being ideal. Very large images (over 10MB) may slow loading times, so adjust to a reasonable size. Photos taken with smartphone cameras typically have sufficient resolution and can be used directly without adjustment. We support JPG, PNG, and WebP formats, with file sizes up to 10MB."
